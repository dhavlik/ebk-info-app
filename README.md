## Technical Overview

### Architecture
The app follows a **clean architecture pattern** with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models** - Data structures for events, space status, and configuration
- **Services** - Business logic and API communication layer
- **Widgets** - Reusable UI components with single responsibilities  
- **Screens** - Top-level pages that compose widgets and manage state

### Framework & Platform
- **Flutter 3.24.3** - Cross-platform framework for mobile and web
- **Dart** - Programming language with null safety
- **Web Support** - Runs natively in browsers via Flutter Web
- **Android Support** - Native Android APK compilation

### Key Dependencies
- **HTTP Client** - RESTful API communication
- **URL Launcher** - External link and contact integration
- **Flutter Localizations** - Internationalization (i18n) support
- **Local Notifications** - Background status change alerts
- **Intl** - Date/time formatting and localization

### State Management
- **StatefulWidget** - Local component state management
- **Provider Pattern** - Service-based dependency injection
- **Background Timers** - Automatic polling without external state libraries

## API Endpoints

The app integrates with existing EBK services through these endpoints:

### SpaceAPI Integration
- **`https://spaceapi.eigenbaukombinat.de/`** - Main SpaceAPI endpoint
  - Provides real-time hackerspace status (open/closed)
  - Returns space information, contact details, and current state
  - Follows the standard SpaceAPI specification

- **`https://spaceapi.eigenbaukombinat.de/openuntil.json`** - Opening hours endpoint
  - Returns "open until" timestamp when the space is currently open
  - Used for displaying countdown timers and closing notifications

### Event Calendar
- **`https://kalender.eigenbaukombinat.de/json/`** - EBK Calendar API
  - Provides upcoming events in JSON format
  - Returns event details including title, description, date/time, and URLs
  - Supports both regular timed events and all-day events

## How This Code Was Actually Made

### The Honest Truth
This entire Flutter application was **created through AI-assisted development** using GitHub Copilot as the primary coding assistant. The development process was a collaborative conversation between a human developer and an AI, with the AI doing the actual code writing, file creation, and implementation.

### Development Process
- **Initial Requirements**: Human provided high-level requirements for an EBK hackerspace app
- **Iterative Development**: AI suggested architecture, created files, and implemented features step by step
- **Real-time Feedback**: Human tested the app in browser and provided feedback for improvements
- **Continuous Refinement**: AI made adjustments based on testing results and user preferences

### What the AI Did
- **Complete Project Structure**: Created all Flutter files, folders, and configurations from scratch
- **API Integration**: Implemented SpaceAPI and calendar API connectivity with proper error handling
- **UI/UX Design**: Built responsive widgets, theme support, and user interface components
- **Internationalization**: Set up complete German/English localization with ARB files
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive end-to-end tests with mocked API responses
- **Build Configuration**: Set up Android and web builds with proper manifests and icons

### What the Human Did
- **Requirements Definition**: Specified features, endpoints, and desired functionality
- **Quality Assurance**: Tested the app in browser and provided feedback on user experience
- **Design Decisions**: Made choices about colors, layout adjustments, and feature priorities
- **Real-world Validation**: Ensured integration with actual EBK services and APIs

### The Result
A **functional Flutter application** that successfully demonstrates AI-assisted development capabilities. While the app works and integrates with real APIs, the code quality and architecture decisions reflect the strengths and limitations of current AI coding assistants.

This development approach shows **how AI tools can rapidly prototype and implement features**, though traditional development practices like thorough code review, refactoring, and long-term maintainability considerations remain important for production systems.
