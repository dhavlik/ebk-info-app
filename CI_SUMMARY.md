Summary of CI/CD Auto-Format Enhancements:

✅ COMPLETED CHANGES:

1. 🚀 CI Pipeline (main branch pushes):
   - Auto-applies dart format to all code
   - Attempts to commit formatting fixes directly
   - Creates pull request if direct commit fails (branch protection)
   - Prevents CI failures due to formatting issues

2. 🔍 PR Pipeline (pull requests):
   - Checks formatting and generates diff suggestions
   - Posts helpful comments with exact changes needed
   - Provides clear instructions for developers
   - Still fails CI to ensure fixes are applied

3. 🌙 Nightly Pipeline:
   - Auto-formats and attempts to commit any style drift
   - Continues with build even if commit fails (branch protection)
   - Maintains long-term code consistency where possible
   - Runs comprehensive checks on schedule

4. 🪝 Pre-commit Hooks:
   - Enhanced documentation and setup script
   - Clear explanation of auto-fix behavior
   - Local formatting before commits

📋 HOW IT WORKS:
- Main branch: Formatting is auto-fixed, committed directly or via PR
- Pull requests: Developers get formatting suggestions
- Pre-commit: Local formatting prevention  
- Nightly: Catches any style drift over time (where permissions allow)

🎯 BENEFITS:
- No more CI failures due to formatting
- Consistent code style across all branches
- Developer-friendly feedback on PRs
- Automated maintenance of code quality
